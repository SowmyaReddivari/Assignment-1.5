1. Explain hadoop in layman's term

   * In layman's term,hadoop is a collection of open source program.
   * It is freely available for use,reuse and modification.
   * It manages the large amount of data.

2. Explain the components of Hadoop framework
    
      There are three components in hadoop.they are,
             
               * HDFS
               * Map Reduce
               * Yarn
   HDFS:

       * HDFS is a java based file system and it provides scalable and reliable data storage.
       * HDFs splits the file into smaller files before processing and files are also replicated into different servers.
   
   Map Reduce:
      
       * Map redue is used for scheduling and processing the data. 
       * It contains two important tasks.They are Map and Reduce.
       * Map Reduce function mainly operates on key,value pairs. 
  Yarn:
       * It is one of the key features of hadoop.
       * It is a large scale,distributed operated system.

3. Explain the reasons to learn Big data technologies  
    
     The reasons for learning Big data tectnologies:
        
     * They are used for predictive analysis and user behaviour analysis.
     * Big data is a new style of IT emerging.
     * Demand for big data skills are high.
